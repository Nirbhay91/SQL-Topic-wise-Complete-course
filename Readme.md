Sure! Let’s break down the topic of **SQL Concepts & Queries** using the **why, how, and what** format, along with an example in Java and a diagram.

### 1. Database Core Concepts - S1
#### SQL Concepts & Queries

#### Why
Understanding SQL concepts and queries is essential for anyone working with relational databases. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to communicate with databases. It enables users to perform various operations such as querying, updating, and managing data efficiently. By grasping SQL concepts, developers can create robust applications that interact with databases seamlessly.

#### How
To understand SQL concepts and queries, one typically follows these steps:
1. **Learn the Syntax**: Familiarize yourself with the basic SQL syntax for querying databases.
2. **Practice Queries**: Execute various SQL commands, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, to manipulate and retrieve data.
3. **Explore Advanced Queries**: As you progress, dive into more complex queries involving joins, subqueries, and aggregations.

#### What
SQL concepts encompass the fundamental principles of how databases operate and how data can be manipulated through SQL queries. Key concepts include:
- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Commands like CREATE, ALTER, DROP that define and manage database schema.
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE that manage data within the database.
- **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Commands like GRANT and REVOKE that control access to data in the database.

### Example: SQL Query in Java
Here’s an example of how to connect to a database using Java and execute a simple SQL query.

#### Java Code Example
This example uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to a MySQL database and retrieve data from a `users` table.

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.ResultSet;
import java.sql.SQLException;
import java.sql.Statement;

public class SQLExample {
    // Database URL, username, and password
    static final String DB_URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
    static final String USER = "username";
    static final String PASS = "password";

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Connection conn = null;
        Statement stmt = null;

        try {
            // Register JDBC driver
            Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");

            // Open a connection
            System.out.println("Connecting to database...");
            conn = DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL, USER, PASS);

            // Execute a query
            System.out.println("Creating statement...");
            stmt = conn.createStatement();
            String sql = "SELECT id, name, email FROM users";
            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(sql);

            // Extract data from result set
            while (rs.next()) {
                // Retrieve by column name
                int id = rs.getInt("id");
                String name = rs.getString("name");
                String email = rs.getString("email");

                // Display values
                System.out.println("ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name + ", Email: " + email);
            }
            // Clean-up environment
            rs.close();
            stmt.close();
            conn.close();
        } catch (SQLException se) {
            // Handle errors for JDBC
            se.printStackTrace();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle errors for Class.forName
            e.printStackTrace();
        } finally {
            // Finally block used to close resources
            try {
                if (stmt != null) stmt.close();
            } catch (SQLException se) {
            }
            try {
                if (conn != null) conn.close();
            } catch (SQLException se) {
                se.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Diagram
Here's a simple diagram illustrating the interaction between a Java application and a relational database through SQL queries.

```plaintext
+--------------------+        +--------------------+
|   Java Application  |        |   Relational DB    |
+--------------------+        +--------------------+
| 1. Load JDBC Driver |        |                    |
| 2. Establish Connection ----->|                    |
| 3. Create Statement  |        |                    |
| 4. Execute SQL Query  |------->|   Execute SQL     |
| 5. Retrieve Results   |<-------|   Return Results  |
| 6. Close Connection    |<------|                    |
+--------------------+        +--------------------+
```
